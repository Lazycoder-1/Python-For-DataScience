# string membership in Python
# simply checks if the character exists in both, e.g 


# when the character exists
a = 'a' in 'Hamburger'
cf = 'c and f' in 'chenford'


# when the character does not exist
b = 'e' not in 'Chicken'
c = 'eel' not in 'food'

# other scenario
raffle_ticket = '158A'
winner = '158a'

out_come = winner in raffle_ticket

#print(b)
print(c)
print(cf)
print(out_come)
