# Introduction to for loops

# simple example with lists
#for element in [1,2,3,4,5,6]:
#    print(element)

# adding all items in a list using for loops
# numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
# total = 0

# for num in numbers:
#     total += num   
# print(total)

# using the range method - add all numbers in a range method
# total_items = 0
# for num in range(1,11):
#     total_items += num
# print(total_items)

# using for loops to count the no of letters in a string
# count the number of 'o' in the sentence
count = 0

for letter in msg:
    if letter == 'o':
        count += 1
print(count)
