# methods and operations on tuples

# using the count method - the no of times a value is present in a tuple
# Example - print(numbers.count(1)) , returns 6 since 1 occurs 6 times 
numbers = (1,1,1,1,2,3,4,5,1,1)
#print(numbers.count(1))

# tuple membership 
print(1 in numbers)
print(17 in numbers)
