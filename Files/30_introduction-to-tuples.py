# introduction to tuples in Python
# Tuples represented by ()
my_tuple = (1,2,3,4,5)

# tuples with different data types
my_tuple_1 = (1,'a',3.42145963,'bc',45)
my_tuple_nested = (1,[1,3,'food',['soccer','baseball']],'movies',345)

# Tuple packing : without using the ()
items = 1, 'Boston',[2,3,4,'New England'],62.46,76

# creating a single element as a tuple - bring a comma as shown below
item = ('winowa',)
print(type(item))
