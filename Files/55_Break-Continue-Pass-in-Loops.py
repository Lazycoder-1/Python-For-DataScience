# break , continue and pass in loops

# simple example - break statement
# for num in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]:
#     if num == 4:
#         break
#     print(num)
# print('This is the results')

# continue statement
# for num in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]:
#     if num == 4:
#         continue
#     print(num)
# print('This is the results after the loop')

# the pass method - if you dont want anything to happen.....
for i in [1,2,3,4,5]:
